Hello, this is the the NOR extracting code straight out of my PS4 NOR Validator. Albeit solely in Zecoxao style.
My personal methodology splits the files themselves from the empty space. Given if you were going to modify the files, its best to put them back in with the idea that it will FIT.

I also noticed people were converting Zecoxao's extraction code into Python etc, so hey! What about PERL?!

Either way mine is still done somewhat differently, I imagine.

This language is super easy, yet I still manage to write it like I have never programmed anything in my life. Don't worry I am now doing OOP in my post-grad degree!

I hope you can understand my spaghetti code and enjoy it and perhaps even learn from it!
